[MultiFilter](https://github.com/mebuie/WABCustomWidgets/tree/master/widgets/MultiFilter) 

The MultiFilter aims to address some of the issues of the Group Filter widget, such as only being able to apply one 
group filter at a time. In addition, the user can build independent filter expressions for each layer in the 
group.

[StreetView](https://github.com/mebuie/WABCustomWidgets/tree/master/widgets/StreetView) 

The StreetView Widget opens a new browser tab showing the closest Google Street view at the selected location.
If no Street View exists, the map returns black.
