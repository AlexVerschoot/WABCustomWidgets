[MultiFilter](https://github.com/mebuie/WABCustomWidgets/tree/master/widgets/MultiFilter) 

The MultiFilter aims to address some of the issues of the Group Filter widget, such as only being able to apply one 
group filter at a time. In addition, the user can build independent filter expressions for each layer in the 
group.
