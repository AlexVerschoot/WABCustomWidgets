## MultiFilter
This widget behaves similar to the Group Filter widget, but with a UI that resembles the Filter Widget. 

The MultiFilter aims to address some of the issues of the Group Filter widget, such as only being able to apply one 
group filter at a time. In addition, the user can build independent filter expressions for each layer in the 
group.
